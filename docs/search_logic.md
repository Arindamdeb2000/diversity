# Structure of the humanpredictions Public Diversity Campaign	

1. humanpredictions has setup a Diversity github repository with the intention of complete transparancy and eventually becoming open source to allow for future expansion and feedback from the public.
2. The **spreadsheets** branch of the repository holds the .CSV files that each contain a type of list to be used for slightly different search functionality.
3. The items in the .CSV files will be programmatically turned into concatenated OR-strings for use in browser searching or a wide variety of applications.  
4. Once the repository is made public, the public will be able to make additions to the .CSV files to add new data, and a pull request will be made to be reviewed by an hp team member.
5. There will be functionality to monitor for duplicates, and for alphabetizing for ease of use. 
6. In the beta version of the project, the following .CSV files will be included: 
	 - **keywords.csv** contains the keywords related to diversity of all kinds for searching purposes.
	 - **meetups.csv** contains URLs for specific meetups with a diversity component and is broken down into geographical areas.  
	 - **groups_and_organizations.csv** will contain organizations and associations representing diverse groups.  
	 - **github_repos.csv** will contain diversity related github repositories and can be used to see profiles of the contributors to those repos.
	 - **hashtags.csv** will contain hashtags that are associated with or related to diverse groups or topics and can be used within an application that utilizes hashtags.
