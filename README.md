In November of last year I posted an article titled
["Intentional Recruiting for diversity"](http://blog.humanpredictions.io/intentional-recruiting-for-diversity/)

We had such a great response from this post that we decided to do a follow up
post and share the new resources, groups and organizations people shared with us
in response to the original article.

When our team started discussing and working on an updated list to share, we
realized there was more we could do than just write a follow up blog post.

We have decided to create this project to manage this growing
[list of amazing groups, organizations, resources, etc.](../master/spreadsheets/groups_and_organizations.csv)
The point of creating an open source project is to allow anyone interested in
this information to have access to it, track the evolution and growth of the
list as well as have the opportunity and ability to contribute to the list
and/or the overall project/mission.

In addition to the growing list of groups, organizations and resources we will
Also be creating a library of [free boolean search strings](../master/docs/google_searches.md)
which anyone may use to help discover diverse groups people who are publicly
active on sites like [meetup](https://meetup.com) or share pronouns and other
information identifying them as an ally on public sites.

Finally, as a product that has a diversity search feature, we are also releasing
the [exact logic](../master/docs/search_logic.md) of how our diversity search feature
works in hopes that folks can [give us feedback](mailto:diversity@humanpredictions.io)
and/or ideas as to how we can improve our feature moving forward.

We by no means think our search is perfect or all encompassing, but we are
hopeful that by being transparent about how it works, we can get feedback from
people who care about diversity and are smarter than us to continue to improve
It.
